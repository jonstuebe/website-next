I work at [SmartRent](https://smartrent.com). We're currently in the process of building a new design system that is cross platform and supports ios & android native apps as well as mobile and desktop web. We've been able to accomplish this through the use of [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web). If you're not familiar with React Native Web I'd highly encourage you to go check it out. The TLDR is that it gives you the same api's as [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) while rendering with `react-dom`.
