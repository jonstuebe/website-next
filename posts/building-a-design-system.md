I work at <a href="https://smartrent.com/" target="_blank">SmartRent</a>. We're currently in the process of building a new design system that is cross platform and supports ios & android native apps as well as mobile and desktop web. We've been able to accomplish this through the use of <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> and <a href="https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web" target="_blank">React Native Web</a>. If you're not familiar with React Native Web I'd highly encourage you to go check it out. The TLDR is that it gives you the same api's as <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" target="_blank">React Native</a> while rendering with `react-dom`.
