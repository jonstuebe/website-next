I haven't been very good at keeping up with blogging in the past and usually have all sorts of excuses around not having the site I like or not having content to write about. But truth is sometimes we just need to dig deep and form some [good habits](https://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/).

So with that said, 2021 is the year that I'm going to hold myself to blogging. Maybe not a ton, but at least one blog post every month. This month (since this doesn't really count) I'm going to do a post on how I built this site and any pieces that I found interesting while building it.
